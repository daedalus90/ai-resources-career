Over the next few years we're going to see a huge change in way we live and work as A.I. and Machine Learning systems work their way into all aspects of our lives.

In order to stay ahead of the curve, and avoid being overwhelmed with these new technologies, I've put together this list of ressources to help get you from zero to being able to leverage A.I. to it's fullest.

This guide is for the practical use of A.I., not engineering or building A.I. or Machine Learning systems youself. 

## How to use this guide
- This guide is meant be be consumed top to bottom, with foundational content at the beginning, and more advanced content towards the bottom. If you find the content to be rudimentary, feel free to skip down. I've include various formats of content, books, videos, articles, podcasts, etc. Each is labeled with their content type.

## Introduction to A.I. in 2023
* (Tool) [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/): This tool kicked off the current renaissance of A.I., and brought A.I. mainstream. It is built by the company OpenAI, which has several A.I. models it offers, from text to image generation. I encourage you to sign up and start leveraging ChatGPT in your daily life/work, ask it to summarize articles for you, ask it for help writing code, ask it for help generating content for your resume. Start using it and get a feel for how to write prompts to get an A.I. to generate the content you want.
